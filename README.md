# ✊ 🖐 ✌ Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game built in Python where you play against the computer. The game keeps track of scores and continues until you decide to quit.

## 🎮 How It Works

1. The player is prompted to enter their name.
2. The game repeatedly asks for a move: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissor`.
3. The computer randomly selects its move.
4. The winner of each round is determined using standard rules:
   - Rock beats Scissor
   - Scissor beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
5. Scores are updated after each round.
6. The game ends when the player types `quit` or `exit`.

## 🧾 Rules

- **Rock > Scissor**
- **Scissor > Paper**
- **Paper > Rock**
- Same choices result in a **draw**.
